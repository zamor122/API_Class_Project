## Description
This is a Client for the GoogleMaps, googleplaces API. This is going to have a command line UI system that will be much easier to use so no coding is necessary. 
## System Requirements 
Python 2.7
...more to come
## The User Interface
The command line user interface is going to be simple and easy to use. There will be several different options and make tasks more convenient to use Google Places.
## Sprint Log:
Sprint 1:
  So far the amount completed is building the basic functionality for Google Places such as having the ability to find the top 10 locations using user provided key words. 
Sprint 2:
  Next my goal will be to implement dense error handeling and more functionality such as narrowing results and building a better looking UI.
