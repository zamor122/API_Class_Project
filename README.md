## Sprint Log:
### Sprint 1:
  So far the amount completed is building the basic functionality for Google Places such as having the ability to find the top 10 locations using user provided key words.

### Sprint 2:
   During this sprint I was able to change the code and maximize readability. I was able to add functionality such as finding the user's exact city and location. I was also able to add more error handling and directions for the user.

### Sprint 3:
  I was able to add additional functionality to get the address of the places searched for as well as the ratings. I also added very dense error capturing so to prvent any errors when submitting a request.
